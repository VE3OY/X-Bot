Authored by VE3OY Matt (FEB-2020)
- Added notations in source file describing various functions.

- Cleaned up source code eliminating TAB characters.

- Command added: TIME
  Returns the date and time at the node.
  Good if you are querying a distant node.

- Command added: VERSION

- Function added:
  Change any incoming command from uppercase to lowercase.
  The program's IF-THEN-ELSE structure depends on the command
  being in lowercase.  This will help to eliminate typos like:
  Time -or- TiMe -or- tImE

- Formatting:
  Changed the X-Bot response format to make it a more readable
