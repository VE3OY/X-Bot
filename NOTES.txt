Notes for X-Bot v0.4
--------------------

1) Edit x-bot.c and change:
   - #define CALL ... enter your conversd node call sign (with a SSID of "-x" is suggested).
   - #define CHANNEL ... set this to the channel you want X-Bot to join and sit on.
   - #define TOPIC ... set what ever TOPIC you want for your channel.
   - #define SERV_TCP_PORT ... default is port 3600.  Change if you use a different port.
   - #define SERV_HOST_ADDR ... default is 127.0.0.1, but you can point it to another server.

2) Compile your changes:
   From the source directory, type:
   - "make clean"
   - "make x-bot"
   - "make install"

The default installation directory is /usr/local/bin.
You can change the installation directory, but editing "makefile".

3) CRON:
   - look in the "install" directory of this repository.
   - copy "conv.sh" to /usr/local/bin directory
   - look inside file "x-conv-check" ... copy that single line
   - edit "/etc/crontab" and insert the single line at the bottom
   - save your changes and exit your editor

At this point, you should have the X-Bot daemon running, and CRON will run
"conv.sh" once a minute (which checks the channel topic and resets it if needed).

Enjoy!
