Notes for X-Bot v0.4
--------------------

1) Edit x-bot.c and change:
   - #define CALL ... enter your conversd node call sign (with a SSID of "-x" is suggested).
   - #define CHANNEL ... set this to the channel you want X-Bot to join and sit on.
   - #define TOPIC ... set what ever TOPIC you want for your channel.
   - #define SERV_TCP_PORT ... default is port 3600.  Change if you use a different port.
   - #define SERV_HOST_ADDR ... default is 127.0.0.1, but you can point it to another server.

2) Compile your changes:
   From the source directory, type:
   - "make clean"
   - "make x-bot"
   - "make install"

The default installation directory is /usr/local/bin.
You can change the installation directory, but editing the "Makefile" file.

3) CRON:
   - look in the "install" directory of this repository.
   - copy "conv.sh" to /usr/local/bin directory
   - type in the command "chmod +x /usr/local/bin/conv.sh" then press [ENTER]
   - look inside the file "x-conv-check". Copy that single line.
   - edit "/etc/crontab" and insert the single line at the bottom
   - save your changes and exit your editor

At this point, you are ready to start your CONVERSD server.
- cd into directory /usr/local/bin
- issue the command "conv.sh" then press [ENTER]

You should now have the CONVERSD and X-Bot daemons running.
You can check to see if they are running by using commands:
"pidof conversd" ... or ... "pidof XBot"

CRON will run "conv.sh" once every minute, and checks that CONVERSD and XBot are running.
If either daemon is NOT running, then it will start them.

Enjoy!
